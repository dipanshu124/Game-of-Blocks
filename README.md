This project required extensive use of OOP concepts - usings classes, strongly-scoped enum classes, use of virtual functions, multiple contructors and contructor delegation.

This repository contains only relevant files of the project in which I used OOP concepts.(The complete codebase can be found at https://github.com/xapian/xapian)
